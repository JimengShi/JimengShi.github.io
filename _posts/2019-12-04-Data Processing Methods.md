## 1 Introduction
In engineering practice, the data we get may contain a large number of missing values, repeated values, outliers, etc., and a large amount of noise. It may also be that there are outliers due to manual input errors, which is not conducive to the training of algorithm model. The result of data cleaning is to process all kinds of "dirty" data in a corresponding way to obtain standard, clean and continuous data for data statistics, data mining, etc. For the task of data preprocessing, it is commonly said that there are four steps: data cleaning, data integration, data transformation and data normalization.
