## Memory & Storage

There are a lot of memories in the computer. They can be divided into 2 big categories: internal memeory and external memory. 
**The big difference between them is to see if the CPU exchanges data directly.**


### Internal memory (Directly)


- Register: Embedded into CPU, used to save the temporary data.
- Cache: Embedded into CPU, as a buffer used to coordinate the speed between CPU and RAM.
- RAM (Random Access Memory): main memory. Inside data will be deleted after cutting off the electricity.
- ROM (Read-Only memory): main memory. used to record the basic I/O information. Inside data will NOT be deleted after cutting off the electricity.
    
    
### External memory (Indirectly)
    
- HDD (Hard Disk Drive)
- SDD (Solid State Disk)
- Cloud Storage
