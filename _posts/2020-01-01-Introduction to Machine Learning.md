## What is Machine Learning?

Arthur Samuel (1959): "Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.

Tom Michel (1999): "A computer program is said to learn from experience (E) with respect to some class of tasks (T) and performance measure (P), if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E." 

The checkers example, E = 10000s games, T is playing checkers, P if you win or not.

## Several types of learning algorithms

##### Supervised learning
You first have a data set and know what the correct output is. You can consider it as supervised learning if its corresponding dataset has the exact labels. The supervised learning problem is classified into a Regression problem and a Classification problem.

- Regression problem
In a regression problem, we try to predict the outcome in a continuous output, which means we try to map the input variable to a continuous function. For example, given a photo of a person, predicting age based on the photo, this is a regression problem.

- Classification problem
In the classification problem, we try to predict the outcome in the discrete output which means we try to map input variables into discrete categories. For example, given to a patient with a tumor, we have to predict whether the tumor is malignant or benign.

##### Unsupervised learning

##### Reforcement learning

##### Recommendation systems
